# GameStop Web Store - Project 1
A simulated online store front using an MVC design pattern. The users are able to register, login, and make purchases. There are multiple locations which the user can choose from, each with their own up-to-date inventory. The user has the option to view the order history of any location as well as their own order history.

## Technologies Used
* ASP.NET
* Microsoft Entity Framework
* SQL Server

## Installation
To run locally:
git clone https://github.com/12142020-dotnet-uta/P1_TravisMartin.git

## Usage
New users can register with their first name, last name, username, password, and email address. After registration, they will be directed to a page with a link to login. The login can also be found in the navbar of the home page. After a usre is signed in, they unlock more options in the navbar. They are now able to select a store, and order from that stores inventory. This will redirect them to the cart page so that they can checkout. Back on the home page, a user can view a stores order history, search for other customers by email address, or search their own order history.
